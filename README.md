ConsoleLog is an app designed for anyone who enjoys playing video games.

Specifically, have you ever had a big break from playing a certain game, and then when you come back to it you completely forget what you were doing or what you were up to?

I know that's happened to me, more than once.

In this app you can:
- Browse an extensive gaming database (via [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/))
- View various information about games
- Add Games to your Game Collection
- Add Play Sessions to any games that are in your Collection (including date, time, duration and notes!)

## Next Steps
- As a User, I want to filter the game list by Gaming Platform (Console) so I only see game relevant to my preferred gaming Platform.
- As a User, I want to sort the game list by average user rating so I can find the most popular games.
- As a User, I want to sort the game list by release date so I can see the newest or oldest games.
- As a User, I want to see the trailer for a game to see if it's a game I might enjoy.
- As a User, I want the app to search as I type into the search bar so I don't have to press the search button but it will automatically start searching.
- As a User, if I search for a game, I will click on a game to see the game detail, when I go back, I want my search results to still be visible and the search still be active.
- As a User, I want to be warned (with a popup or similar) that my play sessions will be deleted when I remove a game from my collection (not a problem at the moment as play sessions are not removed if a game is removed from the user's collection).
